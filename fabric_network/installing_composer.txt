Installing Fabric pre-requisites:
1. curl -O https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/prereqs-ubuntu.sh
2. chmod u+x prereqs-ubuntu.sh
3. ./prereqs-ubuntu.sh

Installing Composer on Linux (proper):

1. Install NVM (node version manager)
	run: curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.8/install.sh | bash
	This will git clone & install NVM in ~/.nvm dir, re-open terminal after install and verify installation with `command -v nvm`, should output `nvm`
	(https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.md#installation)
2. Upgrade/Install NPM with NVM 
	run: nvm install node

3. Install all the composer npm stuff (note: some packages will start compiling C-code! Don't be scared by strange looking output, it's not running Fabric)
	npm install -g composer-cli@next
	npm install -g generator-hyperledger-composer@next
	npm install -g composer-rest-server@next
4. Install Yeoman, code generation tool
	npm install -g yo

Composer Playground, this is basically a site that allows you to create Business Network Defitions from your browser and execu
te some simple low-level commands such as asset creation. The "test"-area is very much like a SQL Workbench.

Having gotten some grips with Composer, I have to say the playground is quite essential to my current dev workflow. The big changes I do locally in Sublime then just pase the code over and do the necessary fixes there. Once no errors there, I copy back and commit. This is much faster to do than running the Composer archive command (it checks your code and outputs detected errors in terminal) 

	npm install -g composer-playground@next


Fabric-tools install:
	mkdir ~/fabric-tools && cd ~/fabric-tools
	curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/composer-tools/master/packages/fabric-dev-servers/fabric-dev-servers.zip
	unzip fabric-dev-servers.zip

Fabric dev environment initial setup:
	export FABRIC_VERSION=hlfv11
	cd ~/fabric-tools
	./downloadFabric.sh
	./startFabric.sh
	./createPeerAdminCard.sh

Now you have a dev environment for the two test networks, Rotterdam Logistics manual will follow

1. Install the composer runtime for our rotterdam_logistics_blocklab business network
	composer runtime install --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1 --businessNetworkName rotterdam_logistics_blocklab

2. Deploy the network from the business network archive
	composer network start --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1 --networkAdmin admin --networkAdminEnrollSecret adminpw --archiveFile rotterdam_logistics_blocklab@0.0.1.bna --file networkadmin.card

	This will also create a networkadmin.card file in your current directory. Please do not commit this file.

3. Import the newly created Network Administrator card
	composer card import --file networkadmin.card

4. Check if network is running
	composer network ping --card admin@rotterdam_logistics_blocklab


----UPGRADING TO HYPER LEDGER FABRIC 1.1----
To upgrade execute the following commands first:

1. Remove composer cards/connection profiles
	composer card list
	composer card delete --name admin@rotterdam_logistics_blocklab
	composer card delete --name PeerAdmin@hlfv1

   Delete the cards in /tmp/ (typed this from memory, name and/or extension might differ!)
	rm /tmp/PeerAdmin@hlfv1.card
	rm /tmp/admin@rotterdam_logistics_blocklab.card

   Flush cards from local store (the composer commands didn't remove anything for me initially)
    rm ~/.composer/cards -rf

2. Remove previous composer versions
	npm uninstall -g composer-cli
	npm uninstall -g composer-rest-server
	npm uninstall -g generator-hyperledger-composer
	npm uninstall -g composer-playground

3. Remove Fabric
	cd ~/fabric-tools (assuming this is where you initially extracted the fabric-tools archive)
	./teardownAllDocker.sh (choose option 2)

4. Remove Tools
	rm ~/fabric-tools -rf

5. Redownload the Fabric-Tools as outlined in the install section
6. Do installation step 3, skip 4, install the new playground too
7. run start_test_network.sh
8. enjoy!
